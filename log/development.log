(They are also 8% below their recent high water mark in 2007, when they hit $56,436.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-266390\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"266390\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F265980%2Famerican-families-are-stuck-in-a-lost-quarter-century%2Fi%2F266390%2F\\u0026text=American+families+are+stuck+in+a+lost+quarter+century\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F265980%2Famerican-families-are-stuck-in-a-lost-quarter-century%2Fi%2F266390%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/09/us-inflation-adjusted-median-household-income-us-median-household-income_chartbuilder.png?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/09/us-inflation-adjusted-median-household-income-us-median-household-income_chartbuilder.png?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor anyone who\\u0026#8217;s been following economic data over the last few years, this shouldn\\u0026#8217;t come as much of a surprise. While the US economy has finally filled in the giant jobs crater left by \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MatthewPhillips/status/474891502255366144\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"s1\\\"\\u003Ethe Great Recession\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E, real wage growth \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/251752/why-obama-is-getting-zero-credit-for-the-improving-us-economy/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eremains virtually nonexistent\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EOn the other hand, salaries on the high end of the spectrum have rebounded quite nicely. Today\\u0026#8217;s Census data shows that the bar for entry into the top 5% of income rose to $196,000, up 2.5%.

A fairer comparison to Herbstreit might be Doris Burke, an NBA color commentator for ESPN. It\\u0026#8217;s her job to analyze basketball games (and she\\u0026#8217;s good at it).

HR is still focused on business process improvement and automation\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAccording to recent research by Sierra-Cedar (formerly CedarCrestone) as part of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.sierra-cedar.com/annual-survey/\\\"\\u003Ethe 2013-2014 HR Systems study\\u003C/a\\u003E of over 1200 companies, the top priorities for HR are business process improvements (62%), automation of talent processes (44%), and service delivery improvements (40%).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBusiness intelligence and metrics are tied fourth on the list with HR systems strategy at 33%. This means that HR is still on a self-discovery expedition still looking to improve its processes, technology, and how it serves its constituents before starting to analyze how HR metrics tie into greater intelligence for the company.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Most of us do not have a single source \\u003C/strong\\u003Eof information\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAccording to the same Sierra-Cedar survey, a benchmark for the HR technology industry, on average companies have 3.1 HR systems in place. Without a single source of truth or accurate data, it is very difficult to rely on any data. More often companies fall back on much smaller data sets captured by the payroll system to report on basic elements such as headcount, turnover, retention, new hire retention, internal promotions, and labor costs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis type of reporting has many limitations as it prevents HR from being a better business partner. This is consistent with findings from a Ceridian survey where 92% of companies still rely on spreadsheets to report on HR data.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. We still rely on IT\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EResearch from \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.aberdeen.com/research/7968/ai-workforce-analytics-optimization/content.aspx\\\"\\u003EAberdeen Group\\u003C/a\\u003E shows that only a third of the top best organization (HR-wise) self-service reporting dashboards to senior leaders, even less (25%) to line of business managers. HR is still getting key metrics to the decision makers, which usually means that IT is involved in pulling the right data. The more HR relies on others, the less actionable data becomes for decision makers due to the risk of staleness.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo what can we do today to get HR on the right track to make use of big data?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. Continue focusing on our process and technology\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe biggest hurdle for HR to be a better business partner is being mired by the burden of administrative and tactical tasks. Streamlining workflows and adding technology to automate is the best way to start. By providing the right tools to the business, HR is better equipped to establish confidence in the data it provides to leadership.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Start measuring today \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDefine key metrics to report on the effectiveness of HR. It’s OK to start with spreadsheets and expand wide or deep. The most critical objective to accomplish is uncovering and tracking metrics that align to the business goals of the company.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3. Choose the right technology\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESometimes simply adding a third-party tool to fragmented systems and databases could work as a stop-gap, but it is not scalable. When ready, look for solutions that are built as single applications on single databases and do not rely on interfaces between HR, workforce management, and talent management systems.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA huge plus is a vendor that doesn’t rely on third-party tools (partnerships) to provide analytics. This is all about having an absolute single source hat will help manage HR data regardless of the size of the data sets.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=265253\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/265253/the-way-hr-works-needs-to-change-heres-how/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-09-16T05:00:35-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=265253\",\"dc_creator\":\"Jayson Saba\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/09/rtr2b7bo.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"documents\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/09/rtr2b7bo.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/265253/the-way-hr-works-needs-to-change-heres-how/"], ["published_at", Tue, 16 Sep 2014 12:00:35 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The way HR works needs to change—here&#8217;s how"], ["updated_at", Tue, 16 Sep 2014 17:18:12 UTC +00:00]]

That apart, there are six other take-aways from Tuesday’s by-election results (32 assembly seats in eight states) that are equally, if not more, important for the future course of Indian politics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EDon’t expect the BJP to give up its communal card yet\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe loss of eight seats in Uttar Pradesh, the state where the BJP went out of its way to rake up divisive issues like the ‘love jihad’ hoax, ought to have sent a message to the party high command that communalism does not pay. But there will be enough Sangh Parivar hotheads in UP, Nagpur and Delhi who will argue the opposite: that the party erred in not being even more aggressive in its “pro-Hindu” campaign. These elements will argue that this is why many Hindu voters—including Dalits, whom the BJP was hoping to attract in the absence of Bahujan Samaj Party candidates—chose to repose their faith in the “pro-Muslim” Samajwadi Party. They will argue that where there was not only overt communalization but violence as well—as in Saharanpur—the BJP was able to retain its seat. For Sangh hardliners, Modi’s call for a “10-year moratorium” on communalism is meaningless since they do not believe their agenda and methods are communal. The prime minister’s silence in the face of the anti-Muslim rhetoric of his party colleagues suggests his own definition of what constitutes communalism might also be at variance with the national consensus.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe SP’s gains in UP appear temporary\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMayawati’s decision to avoid putting up any BSP candidates in the by-elections might have been motivated by her desire to ensure the defeat of the Samajwadi Party but the consolidation of anti-BJP votes this led to actually helped the SP romp home. If in Bihar, opposition unity was created by design, in UP it appeared by default. The results certainly highlight the vulnerability of the BJP to a united opposition—a point RJD chief Lalu Prasad made to both the BSP and SP last month and which SP leader Mulayam Singh accepted—but the chances of Mayawati burying the hatchet are considered close to zero. In the run up to the 2017 assembly elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, therefore, the BJP can be fairly confident about facing a divided opposition. In a three-cornered contest, the BJP would not do as badly as it did in these by-elections.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003ENarendra Modi\\u0026#8217;s position within the Sangh Parivar has been strengthened\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe failure of the BJP in UP and its weakening in Gujarat and Rajasthan may mean there is no ‘Modi wave’ but it also reinforces the idea that the party organization has no other crutch to lean on. The party’s spokespersons have dutifully reminded us all that the Prime Minister did not campaign this time and that by-elections are not fought on ‘national’ issues. The sub-text of this readout is that Anandiben Patel and Vasundhara Raje need to carry the can for Tuesday’s seat losses in their states themselves and that the supreme leader himself cannot be blamed. As for UP, despite the failure of NaMo-acolyte Amit Shah and his hand-picked chief campaigner, Yogi Adityanath, there are enough political variables in the mix for Modi to emerge unscathed and even stronger.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe BJP cannot easily dictate terms to its allies\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe BJP has a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha and Modi may still retain his national cache, but the party is slowly realizing that the quest for power in the states revolves around the strength of its provincial leadership and the local alignment and balance of political forces. The BJP’s high-handedness in dealing with allies has already driven the Haryana Janhit Congress of Kuldeep Bishnoi away. In Maharashtra, much to the BJP’s consternation, the Shiv Sena has said it plans to contest the lion’s share of seats in the upcoming assembly elections and that Uddhav Thackeray will be the National Democratic Alliance’s chief minister.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EThe BJP is slowly realizing that the quest for power in the states revolves around the strength of its provincial leadership.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile BJP president Shah has been talking tough, the party’s poor showing on Tuesday has surely reduced his bargaining power. As an editorial on the results in \\u003Cem\\u003ESaamna\\u003C/em\\u003E, the Sena’s organ, bluntly advised the BJP: \\u0026#8220;Don\\u0026#8217;t let success go to your head, keep your feet on the ground.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe BJP will look to make inroads in eastern India\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe victory of one assembly seat each in West Bengal and Assam may not compensate the BJP for its losses in UP, Rajasthan and Gujarat but it will encourage those within the party organization who have been arguing for a ‘look east’ policy. The three major eastern states—West Bengal, Assam and Odisha—account for 77 Lok Sabha seats. The weakening of the Left Front in West Bengal, the dissipation of the Asom Gana Parishad in Assam and the decimation of the Congress in Odisha opens the door for the BJP to make major inroads here. In Bengal, not only did the BJP wrest the Basirhat South seat from the CPI(M) but the latter’s candidate ended up losing his deposit. And though Trinamool comfortably won Chowringhee, the BJP came second there.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe Congress does have a young leader who can produce results\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile the Congress vote in UP collapsed, the party can take comfort from the fact that it wrested three seats from the BJP in Rajasthan barely 10 months after suffering its worst-ever defeat in the state. While the reserved seat of Weir fell into the lap of the Congress because the BSP, which won a quarter of the votes in 2013 chose not to contest, Surajgarh and Nasirabad registered solid swings towards the party. The fact that the man in charge of the Congress campaign was Sachin Pilot will strengthen the belief that if the party wants to have any hope of staging a political comeback at the national level, it has to be on the basis of a younger leadership with a proven capacity to deliver results.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"edition-credit india\\\"\\u003EThis article is a part of Quartz India.

And Iraq is comparatively uncomplicated—in Syria, if ISIL is defeated, will the West simply move on to backing Syrian rebels in their civil war against Bashar al-Assad\\u0026#8217;s regime? How will Russia and China respond to that?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe danger is not that the US and its coalition will be unable to scatter ISIL to the winds, but that it will not have the capacity to leave behind stable institutions afterward without a massive (and thus unlikely) deployment of troops and cash.
